# Social Media Sharing Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to share products on various social media platforms directly from your e-commerce store.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **Social Platforms Supported:**
- **Facebook** - Share product with description
- **Twitter/X** - Share with hashtags and product link
- **WhatsApp** - Share via WhatsApp with product details
- **LinkedIn** - Professional sharing
- **Pinterest** - Share with product image
- **Telegram** - Share via Telegram

### ✅ **Additional Features:**
- **Native Device Sharing** - Uses device's native share functionality when available
- **Copy to Clipboard** - Quick link copying functionality
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Usage

### In Product Detail Page
- Full share button with dropdown menu showing all platforms
- Located next to "Add to Cart" and "Add to Wishlist" buttons

### In Product Cards
- Compact share button with essential platforms
- "More options" dropdown for additional platforms
- Doesn't interfere with product card click navigation

## How It Works

### 1. **SocialShareService**
```typescript
// Share on specific platform
socialShareService.shareProduct(product, 'facebook');

// Copy link to clipboard
await socialShareService.copyToClipboard(product);

// Native device sharing (if supported)
await socialShareService.nativeShare(product);
```

### 2. **Component Usage**
```html
<!-- Full sharing options -->
<app-social-share [product]="product" [compactMode]="false"></app-social-share>

<!-- Compact sharing options -->
<app-social-share [product]="product" [compactMode]="true"></app-social-share>
```

## File Structure

```
webapp/src/app/
├── services/
│   └── social-share.service.ts         # Core sharing logic
├── components/
│   └── social-share/
│       └── social-share.component.ts   # Sharing UI component
├── components/product-detail/

└── components/product-card/
    ├── product-card.component.ts       # Updated with sharing
    └── product-card.component.html     # Added compact sharing
```

## Customization

### Adding New Platforms
Edit `social-share.service.ts` and add to the `platforms` array:

```typescript
{
  name: 'NewPlatform',
  icon: 'icon-name',
  color: '#hexcolor',
  shareUrl: 'https://newplatform.com/share?url={url}&text={text}'
}
```

### Customizing Share Text
Modify the `shareProduct` method in `SocialShareService`:

```typescript
const shareText = `Check out this amazing product: ${product.name}`;
const hashtags = 'shopping,ecommerce,deals';
```

### Styling
- Global styles are in `styles.scss`
- Component-specific styles are in the component files
- Uses Angular Material components for consistent UI

## Mobile Support
- **Native Sharing**: Automatically uses device's native share sheet when available
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly**: Optimized for mobile interactions

## Analytics (Optional Enhancement)
You can track social sharing events by adding analytics to the sharing methods:

```typescript
shareOnPlatform(platformName: string): void {
  this.socialShareService.shareProduct(this.product, platformName);
  
  // Track analytics (example)
  // this.analytics.track('product_shared', {
  //   platform: platformName,
  //   product_id: this.product._id,
  //   product_name: this.product.name
  // });
}
```

## Browser Compatibility
